# How to Stop macOS from Creating .DS_Store Files

## What Are .DS_Store Files?

When you browse folders in Finder, macOS creates hidden files called `.DS_Store` in the background. These files store things like icon positions, window sizes, and sort preferences.

While youâ€™ll never see them on a Mac, they show up when using the same drive on Windows, Linux, or other platformsâ€”leading to confusion and clutter.

## Option 1: Disable .DS_Store Creation via Terminal

macOS includes settings you can change using Terminal to stop creating `.DS_Store` files on certain types of drives.

### To prevent them on network drives

```bash
defaults write com.apple.desktopservices DSDontWriteNetworkStores -bool TRUE
```

### To prevent them on USB drives

```bash
defaults write com.apple.desktopservices DSDontWriteUSBStores -bool TRUE
```

**Note:**
- Youâ€™ll need to log out or restart for the changes to take effect
- These commands only apply to the specific types of drives mentioned
- They only prevent the creation of new `.DS_Store` files - they don't remove existing ones

1. Open Hidden File Cleaner
