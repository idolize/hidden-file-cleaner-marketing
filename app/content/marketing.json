      {
        "question": "Which specific files does Hidden File Cleaner remove?",
        "answer": "Hidden File Cleaner removes .DS_Store, .fseventsd, .Spotlight-V100, .Trashes, .apdisk, and ._Filename (aka AppleDouble) files."
      },
      {
        "question": "What are these files? Are there any risks with removing them?",
        "answer": "They each do slightly different things. For example, the ._ files can be used by macOS to store things like custom icons you can assign in Finder. .DS_Store can be used to remember icon positions in a Finder window. .Spotlight-V100 is used for Spotlight indexing, etc. None of the information in these files is essential, and they are created automatically when you open a drive in Finder."
      },
      {
        "question": "So what's the problem with these files then?",
        "answer": "If you only use macOS then typically nothing (they are hidden from you anyway). However, if you transfer files to another computer with a different OS then they will show up, causing confusion and even causing problems in some cases (for example: if you transfer files to a SD card for a game console or other device it may show \"corrupted data\" when it reads these metadata files)."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can't I just use Terminal commands to disable these files?",
        "answer": "You can get macOS to stop creating .DS_Store files specifically on certain types of external disks, but unfortunately other types of hidden files will still be created."
