### Our commitment to your privacy

Good news: Hidden File Cleaner doesn’t need to collect your personal data to function, and we strive to avoid collecting personal information as much as possible. It’s just a file cleaning tool, after all!

To remove certain metadata files (.DS_Store, AppleDouble files, etc.), Hidden File Cleaner scans the names of specific files on your system (but never reads or stores any of their contents). All filesystem data remains strictly on your local computer—nothing is transmitted to us or any third party.

However, we do use some information for license management, crash reporting, and analytics. We believe in transparency, so here's exactly what data we handle and why:

### What information we collect and why

#### 1. License Management

When you purchase a license for Hidden File Cleaner, you'll enter your email address and name through our payment provider, Lemon Squeezy. This information is stored securely by Lemon Squeezy—we do not store this information on our servers. Your email address is also embedded into your license key for verification purposes (though it's not stored separately by us).

Lemon Squeezy uses your email to send you a purchase receipt and allows you to log in and retrieve your purchased licenses. For more details, please refer to [Lemon Squeezy's Privacy Policy](https://www.lemonsqueezy.com/privacy).

#### 2. Analytics

To help us improve Hidden File Cleaner, we collect anonymous usage analytics:

- **Within the Hidden File Cleaner app:** We use Google Analytics to understand which features users interact with most. Google Analytics collects anonymous usage data. For more information on Google's practices, see the [Google Analytics Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites).

- **On our marketing website:** We use Cloudflare Web Analytics to better understand how visitors find and interact with our website. Cloudflare’s analytics are privacy-friendly and do not collect personally identifiable information.

#### 3. Crash Reporting

If Hidden File Cleaner crashes, we use Firebase Crashlytics to receive crash reports that help us diagnose and fix issues. Crashlytics collects anonymous data, including:

- Crash stack traces
- Crashlytics Installation UUIDs
- Firebase Installation IDs

This data helps us understand and resolve issues quickly. Firebase retains this data for 90 days before deletion. You can learn more at the [Firebase Crashlytics Privacy Policy](https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy).

### Offline Use

Once activated, Hidden File Cleaner can be used completely offline. No additional data collection occurs while offline, and no other third-party services have access to your information.

### Changes to this Privacy Policy

We may occasionally update this Privacy Policy. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated revision date.
