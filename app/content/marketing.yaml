  title: Frequently Asked Questions
  questions:
    - question: What specific files does Hidden File Cleaner remove from my drives?
      answer: |
        Hidden File Cleaner removes unnecessary macOS metadata files, including
        **.DS_Store**, **.fseventsd**, **.Spotlight-V100**, **.Trashes**, **.apdisk**, and **._ (AppleDouble)** files.
    - question: What are these hidden metadata files on my drives?
      answer: |
        None of these files are essential, but they are created automatically when you open a drive in Finder.
        They are hidden on macOS, but will show up on other operating systems.

        These files serve various system functions, for example:

        - **.DS_Store:** Stores folder view preferences (list view, grid view, etc.) and file positions.
        - **._ (aka AppleDouble):** Stores metadata like custom user-set icons in Finder.
        - **.Spotlight-V100:** Stores Spotlight indexing data for the external drive.

        Hidden File Cleaner clears them to keep your drives tidy and compatible with non-Mac systems.
    - question: Why would I want to remove these hidden metadata files from my drives?
      answer: |
        If you only use Macs, these files are usually hidden and won't bother you.
        However, when transferring files to devices with different operating systems, these hidden files become visible
        and can cause confusion â€“ or even issues.

        For instance, transferring files to an SD card for a game console or other device might result in
        "corrupted data" errors due to these metadata files.
        Removing them ensures smooth compatibility and a cleaner experience across platforms.
    - question: Can't I use Terminal commands to disable these files?
      answer: |
        Yes and no. It is possible to use Terminal commands to get macOS to stop creating **.DS_Store** files specifically
        on certain types of external disks. However, other types of hidden metadata files will still be created.
    - question: How does the Background Cleaning feature work?
      answer: |
        Background Cleaning runs quietly in your menu bar, automatically removing hidden metadata files as soon as
        they're created in specified locations. It remains idle otherwise, using virtually no CPU or resources.
        This saves you the hassle of manually cleaning your drives.
